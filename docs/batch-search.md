Searches posts by combining multiple terms into optimized OR queries. Auto-packs terms into the minimum number of API calls within the 512-char query limit, deduplicates results, and merges expanded users. Prefer this over multiple `search` calls when querying several related terms. Invoke via `node <base_directory>/x.js batch-search --terms "term1,term2,..." [flags]`. Output is JSON to stdout.

[!FLAGS] a) `--terms <comma-list>` (required) — search terms, OR'd together. Multi-word terms are auto-quoted (e.g. `deal sourcing` becomes `"deal sourcing"`). b) `--context <comma-list>` — context terms AND'd with the terms group via an OR clause (e.g. `--context "acquisition,M&A"` adds `(acquisition OR "M&A")`). c) `--exclude <comma-list>` — operators to negate (e.g. `is:retweet,is:reply`). The `-` prefix is added automatically if missing. d) `--no-default-exclude` — suppress the default `-is:retweet -is:reply` exclusions. e) `--all` — search the full archive instead of just the last 7 days (requires `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN`). f) `--max-results <10-100>` — results per page per query (up to 500 with --all). g) `--sort <recency|relevancy>` — order results. h) `--start-time <ISO8601>` — oldest timestamp (inclusive). i) `--end-time <ISO8601>` — newest timestamp (exclusive). j) `--since-id <id>` — results newer than this post ID. k) `--until-id <id>` — results older than this post ID. l) `--raw` — output the full merged envelope with `queries_used` count.

[!QUERY-CONSTRUCTION] The command builds queries as follows: 1) Each term is auto-quoted if it contains spaces. 2) Terms are greedy-packed into groups that fit within `512 - suffix_length` chars. 3) Each group becomes a query: `(term1 OR term2) (ctx1 OR ctx2) -is:retweet -is:reply`. 4) Queries execute sequentially (not in parallel) to avoid rate-limit bursts. 5) Results are deduplicated by tweet ID, expanded users are merged, and tweets are sorted by `created_at` descending.

[!OUTPUT-SHAPE] Default produces a deduplicated array of tweet objects sorted by `created_at` descending. With `--raw`, returns `{ data, includes: { users }, meta: { result_count, queries_used } }`.
